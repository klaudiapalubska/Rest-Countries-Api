# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API without color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-design-home-light.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

This is my solution for challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

[Check the live site](https://rest-countries-api-klaudia-palubska.netlify.app)

✔️ I added some extra features, such as a loader while data is being fetched.

✔️ In this challenge, I wanted to test my skills in using an external API.

❌ I didn't add a night mode, so **the dark mode button does not work**.

**Some issues**

❗❗ Sometimes the button appears close to the card with the country when the page is loading
